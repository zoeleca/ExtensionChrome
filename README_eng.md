## Présentation

![illus](images_readme/NeuroPause.png) ![blur](images_readme/Blur.png)

NeuroPause is a browser extension designed to facilitate screen breaks, with special attention to adapting for individuals affected by Asperger Syndrome. The extension offers a medium-sized contextual window that displays soft and calming colors. This design was developed in collaboration with a specialized nurse who specializes in caring for individuals with Asperger Syndrome, ensuring an environment that takes sensory sensitivities into account.

## Features

- **Adapted Contextual Window (POPUP) for Asperger:** The contextual window is designed with simplicity in mind, featuring soft and calming colors to offer a comfortable user experience.

- **Minimal Alerts :** To minimize stress for individuals with Asperger Syndrome, only one alert message is displayed ("Ok for a break?" appearing at the end of the timer before the break). This approach helps avoid potential frustrations that could arise from excessive notifications.

- **Popup Displaying Time Before Break :** Users have the option to start a timer by clicking on the duration of the break. Once activated, the active tab is slightly darkened, and all other tabs are blurred. When the user feels their break is over, they just need to refresh the active tab, and all tabs will become clear again.

## Installation

To use NeuroPause, follow these steps:

1. Install the extension in your Chrome browser.
2. The popup will appear; you can click on "start" if the indicated time suits you or go to the top right corner on the "N", choose "Options" and set another screen time.
3. Fill in the desired screen time duration in the contextual window.
4. The break timer starts, and the screen adapts to encourage a break (blurred).

## Project Context

NeuroPause was developed in close collaboration with a nurse specializing in treating individuals with Asperger Syndrome. Their contribution was crucial in guiding the development of the extension, from design to feature feasibility, through presentation, to ensure optimal adaptation to the needs of the targeted community.

The extension minimizes the amount of text and color variations, taking into account possible sensory sensitivities. It aims to create a support tool for people who might find traditional break application interfaces difficult to navigate.
